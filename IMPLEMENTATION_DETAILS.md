# Implementation Details

## AWS Integration

### Bedrock Client Setup
- The application initializes an AWS Bedrock client using credentials from the authenticated session
- Credentials are refreshed automatically through AWS Amplify's authentication system
- Region configuration is stored in localStorage and loaded on startup

### Session Management
- Chat sessions are identified by timestamps
- Messages are persisted in localStorage by session ID
- Sessions can be cleared and restarted through the UI

### Message Handling
- Messages are stored with metadata including sender and timestamp
- Async/await pattern used for message processing
- Auto-scrolling implemented for new messages

## Security Considerations
- AWS credentials are handled securely through Amplify
- Configuration data is stored in localStorage
- Session tokens are refreshed automatically

## UI Components
- Uses Cloudscape Design System
- Responsive layout
- Accessibility features implemented
- Loading states handled appropriately
