- AWS Account with access to:
  - Amazon Bedrock
  - Amazon Cognito
  - IAM permissions to manage Bedrock and Cognito resources
  - AWS Amplify (optional - only if using Amplify for deployment)

## AWS Setup (Optional - Only if using AWS Amplify)

If you plan to use AWS Amplify for deployment, follow these steps:

1. Configure AWS Amplify

```bash
# Install Amplify CLI globally
npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli

# Configure Amplify CLI with your AWS credentials
amplify configure

# Initialize Amplify in your project
amplify init

# Push the backend resources to AWS
amplify push
```

2. Set up Amazon Bedrock Agent
- Create and configure your Bedrock Agent in the AWS Console
- Note down the Agent ID and other relevant configuration details

## Local Development

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```


2. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at http://localhost:5173

## Building for Production

1. Build the application:

```bash
npm run build
```

2. Test the production build locally:

```bash
npm run preview
```

## Deployment to AWS Amplify

### Option 1: Manual Deployment
1. Build the application:

```bash
npm run build
```

2. Package the dist folder contents:

```bash
cd dist
zip -r ../deployment.zip ./*
```

3. Upload the deployment.zip file through the AWS Amplify Console

### Option 2: Continuous Deployment
1. Connect your repository to AWS Amplify:
   - Go to AWS Amplify Console
   - Click "New App" > "Host Web App"
   - Choose your repository provider
   - Follow the setup wizard

2. Amplify will automatically build and deploy your application when you push changes to your repository

## Sample Cost Analysis

| AWS Service | Dimensions | Cost (USD) |
|----------|----------| ----------|
| Amazon Cognito | 1,000 active users per month without advanced security feature | $0.00/month |
| AWS Amplify | 5 developers committing code twice a day and 300 daily active users, the estimated monthly Amplify costâ€”including build, deploy, and hosting | $8.00/month |
